------------------------------------

 
**NemaNet** is an open-source deep learning framework designed to automatically analyze the anatomical features and track the movement trajectories of _Caenorhabditis elegans_ (_C. elegans_). It is built to help the scientific community better understand the biology of this model organism by offering accurate, efficient, and scalable tools for phenotyping, tracking, and behavioral analysis.

## Contributors
💬 Our vision is to create a **community-driven platform** where researchers and scientists can freely contribute to the annotation of _C. elegans_ images, and use NemaNet to explore biological features, aging processes, and behavioral patterns. We aim to accelerate scientific discoveries by empowering both academic researchers and the open-source community to leverage state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning tools in biological research.

## NemaNet History
### ⭐NemaNet v1 — WormCNN
In its first iteration, NemaNet v1, we introduced WormCNN, a model designed to identify and track _C. elegans_ in 384-well plates. WormCNN was specifically trained to extract age-related image features, enabling studies on aging and lifespan analysis using _C. elegans_ as a model organism.

### ⭐NemaNet v2 — Now
With NemaNet v2, we have significantly expanded the scope of the project. This version supports the identification of _C. elegans_ at arbitrary resolutions, providing more flexibility for various imaging setups. 
# NemaNet v2 is Coming soon!
